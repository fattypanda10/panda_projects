# My Projects

--> The projects present in this repository are the final versions of the Python codes/programs that were made at my end for the Python developer track offered by Hyperskill (JetBrains)

*if you, too, happen to be one of the persons undertaking this track and doing these projects, please, I request, please, do NOT use (blindly copy/paste) these codes for your task submission. It would only be your loss in the end, as there is no point doing something without learning and understanding it. Thank you!
